    "bio": "I'm a software engineer who enjoys solving hard problems. I don't just write code; I care about how the whole system fits together. Whether it is a mobile app or a complex physics engine, I focus on making it fast, clean, and easy to use. Right now, I am getting my Master's degree at UCT. My main project is redesigning a one-of-a-kind high-performance C++ radar simulator (FERS) to make it modern and powerful. Outside of research, I run astraen, my own development lab where I build apps and tools for myself and freelance clients."
